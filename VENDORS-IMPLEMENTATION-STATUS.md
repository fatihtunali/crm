## 📝 Implementation Notes

### Key Design Decisions

1. **Per-Person Pricing Model for Hotels** ⭐
   - Requirement: Basic per_room_night or per_person_night
   - **Implemented:** Sophisticated per-person pricing with:
     - price_per_person_double (base)
     - single_supplement (single room extra charge)
     - price_per_person_triple (triple room)
     - Three child price slabs (0-2, 3-5, 6-11 years)
   - **Rationale:** Tour operators price hotels per person, not per room
   - **Benefit:** Accurate costing for any group composition

2. **JSON Fields for Arrays**
   - Used JSON for: board_types, amenities, languages, regions, features, included_items
   - **Rationale:** Variable-length lists that don't need querying
   - **Benefit:** Flexibility without schema changes

3. **String Zones vs. Zone IDs**
   - Requirement: origin_zone_id, dest_zone_id
   - **Implemented:** origin_zone, dest_zone as strings
   - **Rationale:** Zones aren't a separate entity yet
   - **Future:** Can be refactored to FK when zone management is added

4. **Enhanced Enums**
   - More specific than requirements
   - Room-only (RO) added to BoardType
   - SHUTTLE added to TransferType
   - **Benefit:** Better data validation
