## 🚀 How to Run Tests

### First Time Setup (5 minutes)

**Step 1:** Update `.env.test` with your server IP
```bash
# Edit apps/api/.env.test
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://tourcrm:PASSWORD@YOUR_SERVER_IP:5432/tour_crm_test"
```

**Step 2:** Create test database on your server
```bash
psql -h YOUR_SERVER_IP -U tourcrm -c "CREATE DATABASE tour_crm_test;"
```

**Step 3:** Run migrations
```bash
cd apps/api
npx dotenv -e .env.test -- npx prisma migrate deploy
```

**Step 4:** Run tests!
```bash
npm run test:e2e
```

### Daily Usage

**Run all tests:**
```bash
cd apps/api
npm run test:e2e
```

**Run with coverage:**
```bash
npm run test:e2e:cov
```

**Run specific test:**
```bash
npm run test:e2e -- auth.e2e-spec.ts
```

**Test Failing:** `packages/shared/src/__tests__/currency.test.ts:226`

**Impact:** Could cause pricing errors for very small amounts

**Fix Required:**
```typescript
// Current (line 69)
return Math.round(sellPriceEur * 100) / 100;  // ❌

// Should be
return Math.round(sellPriceEur * 10000) / 10000;  // ✅
```

**Priority:** HIGH - Fix this week

## 🎓 Test Utilities Available

Your test helpers make writing tests easy:

```typescript
// Create authenticated user + get JWT token
const { token, tenantId } = await createAuthenticatedUser(app, {
  email: 'test@test.com',
  password: 'Pass123!',
  role: 'ADMIN'
});

// Create test client
const client = await createTestClient(prisma, tenantId, {
  name: 'Test Client',
  email: 'client@test.com'
});

// Create test lead
const lead = await createTestLead(prisma, tenantId, client.id);

// Create test quotation
const quotation = await createTestQuotation(prisma, tenantId, lead.id, {
  sellPriceEur: 1000,
  status: 'DRAFT'
});

// Create exchange rate
const rate = await createTestExchangeRate(prisma, tenantId, 30.5);

// Clean database between tests
await cleanDatabase(prisma);
```

**Why This Matters:**
- Write tests faster
- Consistent test data
- Less boilerplate code
- Easy to read tests
