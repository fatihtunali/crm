---

### 3. Payment Processing & Idempotency (10 tests) ✅
**File:** `apps/api/test/payments.e2e-spec.ts`
**Status:** ALL PASSING

**Tests Covered:**
- ✅ Prevent duplicate payment with same idempotency key
- ✅ Allow different payments with different idempotency keys
- ✅ Require idempotency key for payment endpoints
- ✅ Create client payment successfully (ACCOUNTING role)
- ✅ Reject payment for non-existent booking
- ✅ Reject payment for another tenant's booking

### 4. Booking Workflow & Exchange Rate Locking (6 tests) ✅
**File:** `apps/api/test/booking-workflow.e2e-spec.ts`
**Status:** ALL PASSING

**Tests Covered:**
- ✅ Prevent accepting quotation without exchange rate
- ✅ Prevent accepting quotation that is not in SENT status
- ✅ Lock correct exchange rate on booking creation
- ✅ Verify exchange rate doesn't change after lock
- ✅ Calculate P&L correctly with locked rate
- ✅ Prevent P&L calculation without locked exchange rate
- ✅ Search and filter bookings

**Key Features Verified:**
- Exchange rate selection by date
- Exchange rate locking at booking creation
- Immutable exchange rates after lock
- Quotation workflow (DRAFT → SENT → ACCEPTED → BOOKING)
- Profit & Loss (P&L) calculations
- Business rule validations
- Error handling for missing exchange rates

**Critical Business Logic:** The exchange rate locking mechanism ensures financial accuracy by preventing rate changes after a quotation is accepted. This protects against currency fluctuations affecting already-confirmed bookings.

### 🐛 Critical Bug Found: Currency Rounding Issue

**File:** `packages/shared/src/utils/currency.ts:69`
**Severity:** ⚠️ MEDIUM (Non-Critical)
**Status:** CONFIRMED BY TESTS

#### Bug Description:
When calculating prices from very small costs (< 0.01 TRY), the rounding logic rounds the result to `0.00 EUR` instead of maintaining precision.

**Test Case:**
```typescript
priceFromCost(0.01 TRY, 25% markup, 30 TRY/EUR)
Expected: > 0
Actual: 0.00 EUR
```

**Calculation:**
```
(0.01 * 1.25) / 30 = 0.000416... EUR
Rounded to 2 decimals = 0.00 EUR ❌
```

**Impact:**
- Affects quotations with very small line items
- Could result in free items in quotations
- Unlikely to occur in real-world tour operator scenarios (minimum item costs are usually > 1 TRY)

**Recommended Fix:**
```typescript
// Option 1: Use ceiling for very small amounts
if (result < 0.01 && result > 0) {
  return 0.01; // Minimum price
}

// Option 2: Increase precision to 4 decimal places for EUR
return Math.round(result * 10000) / 10000;

// Option 3: Add warning/validation for sub-cent amounts
```

**Priority:** MEDIUM - Should be fixed before production, but not a blocker.

   - Payment linked to valid booking
   - Idempotency key provided
   - Payment created successfully

2. **Duplicate Prevention:** ✅
   - Same idempotency key used twice
   - Second request returns cached response
   - Only ONE payment record in database

3. **Authorization:** ✅
   - User without ACCOUNTING role attempts payment
   - Request rejected with 403 Forbidden

4. **Cross-Tenant Security:** ✅
   - Tenant A attempts payment for Tenant B's booking
   - Request rejected with 404 Not Found

### Booking Workflow Scenarios

1. **Normal Flow:** ✅
   - Create client → Create lead → Create quotation → Send quotation → Accept quotation → Booking created

2. **Exchange Rate Locking:** ✅
   - Quotation accepted at Rate 30.5 TRY/EUR
   - Booking locked at 30.5 TRY/EUR
   - Rate updated to 32.0 TRY/EUR in database
   - Booking still uses locked rate 30.5

3. **Validation Rules:** ✅
   - Cannot accept DRAFT quotation
   - Cannot accept quotation without exchange rate
   - Cannot calculate P&L without locked rate

## 🚀 Recommendations

### 1. CRITICAL: Fix Currency Rounding Bug ⚠️
**Priority:** HIGH
**File:** `packages/shared/src/utils/currency.ts:69`
**Action:** Implement minimum price threshold or increase decimal precision

### 2. Expand Test Coverage 📊
**Priority:** MEDIUM
**Missing Coverage:**
- Vendor payment processing
- Invoice generation
- Email notification system
- User & tenant administration
- Supplier catalog management
- Financial reporting

**Recommended:** Add 5-10 tests per module

### 3. Performance Testing 🏎️
**Priority:** MEDIUM
**Action:** Add performance tests for:
- Database queries with large datasets
- Concurrent payment processing
- Multi-tenant query performance
- Exchange rate lookups

### 4. Integration Testing 🔗
**Priority:** LOW
**Action:** Test integrations with:
- Email service (when implemented)
- Payment gateways (future)
- External exchange rate APIs (future)

### 5. Error Handling Improvement 🛠️
**Priority:** LOW
**Current:** Services throw generic `Error` → 500 Internal Server Error
**Better:** Use HTTP exceptions (`BadRequestException`, etc.) for better error messages

**Files to Update:**
- `apps/api/src/quotations/quotations.service.ts:341` - Exchange rate validation
- `apps/api/src/quotations/quotations.service.ts:312` - Status validation
- `apps/api/src/bookings/bookings.service.ts:377` - Rate validation
